## Water security
### Team Poland

The following command creates an environment called `mda_project`, and downloads all dependencies from the `environment.yml` file.
```
conda env create -n mda_project -f environment.yml
```

### App 

This project comes with an [interactive app](https://mda-poland.herokuapp.com). It was initially deployed inside the 'app' branch in this repository. However, for final deployment, a concise and clean version of the code has been put in another repository. That repository can be found [here](https://github.com/karlpolak/MDA-app.git).
